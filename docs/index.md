# godot-game-services

When the plugin is installed and enabled, a singleton `GameServices` instance is available in code. All features of the native plugins are accessed via this singleton. If no native plugin is available, such as when you are running from the Godot editor, these calls do nothing, so can be left in your code without issue.

## Features

* [General](general.html)

* [Leaderboards](leaderboards.html)

## Classes

* [GSPlayer](gsplayer.html)
